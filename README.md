# About the Project
The project demonstrates a simple login application created using `Tkinter` GUI library for `Windows` and `Mac` Systems.

For testing, you can use the following `credentials` (however, later you can connect it to a `database`)

```code
Email    : admin@xyz.com
Password : password
```

You can check the `console` for successful login.
